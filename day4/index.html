              Sloths are mammals noted for slowness of movement and for spending
              most of their lives <b>hanging upside down</b> in the trees of the
              tropical rain forests. It is their anatomy - that allows them to
              chill like this! In the schema on the right you can see which body
              parts allows sloths to be who they are.

            Some sloth families, like Three-toed sloths family Bradypodidae,
            move in the same way but often sit in the forks of trees rather than
            hanging from branches. If you look along forest canopy, apart from
            sitting or hanging, you will see sloths also sunning, resting, or
            feeding on leaves.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you go to the forest and do not see them - maybe they still
            actually are there. It can be that your eyes are defeating you!
            Sloths sleep either perched in the fork of a tree or hanging from a
            branch, with all four feet bunched together and the head tucked in
            on the chest. In this posture the sloth resembles a clump of dead
            leaves, so inconspicuous that it was once thought these animals ate
            only the leaves of cecropia trees because
            <b>in other trees they went undetected</b>.

          The sloth family is big. There are many of them. Each one more cute
          than the other. Sloths like nice places. They live in nature.
          Actually, they spend almost all of their lives in trees. Here are some
          places where they have been seen:
        </p>
        <li>Honduras</li>
        <li>northern South America</li>
        <li>northern Argentina</li>
        <li>small Atlantic forest of southeastern Brazil</li>
        <li>a small Caribbean island off the northwestern coast of Panama</li>
        <p class="trees">
          Sloths like places in the tropical regions of the Earth, where they
          get plenty of sunlight year-round. It also rains there. Sometimes
          there is high and continuous rainfall, with annual rainfall in some
          places between 2.5 and 4.5 metres. Perhaps that is why slots chill in
          the trees. Just in case that rain is about to start and they can't
          make it on time to be high enough.

            <p>
              To better understand how sloths climb the trees and hang in the
              trees, we need to understand the trees. A tree is a perennial
              plant with an elongated stem, supporting branches and leaves in
              most species. Again, in the schema on the right you can see the
              anatomy of the tree.
            </p>

            <p>
              Trees include a variety of plant species that have independently
              evolved a trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants
              to compete for sunlight. The trunk typically contains woody tissue
              for strength, and vascular tissue to carry materials from one part
              of the tree to another. For most trees it is surrounded by a layer
              of bark which serves as a protective barrier.

        <p>
          Below the ground, the roots branch and spread out widely; they serve
          to anchor the tree and extract moisture and nutrients from the soil.

          You wouldn't expect it, but think of their claws! Like in life, they
          do take their time in coding. Turns out, the three-toed sloths code a
          bit faster than two-toed sloths. Researchers have found weird symbols
          on the tree branches, and it wasn't until last year, that by
          coincidence, these symbols were decoded by developers! Below are the
          examples of code that was found on the trees.
        </p>
        <code>#!/bin/bash STR="Hello Sloth!" echo $STR</code> <br />
        <code>int main() { std::cout << "Hello, sloth!\n"; return 0; }</code
        >
        <p class="crazy-text">
          This is crazy, right? But it is real. Perhaps we underestimate these
          creatures just because they are so slow. We do have much more to learn
          about them!
